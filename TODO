newlib/libgloss/pic32/exceptions.c 
 * Code the Stack Save/Restore in _general_exception_context()
 * figure out why I can't have both a nomips16 and weak attribute on the
   same function

newlib/libgloss/pic32/crt0.S
 * either import Microchips version (after we get approval) or Write our own

newlib/libgloss/pic32/read.c, write.c
 * output to USART2 as per the standard Microchip libc

Misc:
 * Test atexit() function calls really do "run" when exit() is called
 * Check what other "syscalls" are missing from the pic32mx libgloss
   function (ie, libpic32.a - the Hardware Abrastraction Layer for newlib)
