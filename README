Bef installation instructions

What you need:
1) The C32 Suite installed and access to copy them to your unix box
2) A installed/functioning C32 GCC compiler for your unix box (See
http://www.paintyourdragon.com/uc/osxpic32/index.html but read below for
important info)

3) The pic32 port of newlib
(http://svn.neostats.net/svn/pic32-newlib/Trunk/)

What my assumptions are:
1) I'm not installing to the system wide directory, but to a private home
directory (hence, the c32 install.sh script is not valid)

What you do:
1) Firstly, follow the instructions to build your GCC version that is
contained on Phillip Burgess's page above.

(I made one change to the build.sh directory - On Line 48, changed the
--prefix option to "/home/pic32/". I suggest for the moment you do the same,
as I don't know if the newlib files will mess up your System Include files
or not - If you do this, you also should add the new /home/pic32/bin
directory to your Path)

2) Ignore the install.sh script that Phillip Burgess provides, as we will be
using only a limited number of files (for now) from the C32 Suite

3) In the GCC directory, you can execute "make install" and this should
install the GCC files into directories such as /home/pic32/bin and
/home/pic32/lib etc

4) From the C32 Suite, Place the following files (preserving directory
structures etc) into the following directory:
/home/pic32/pic32mx/include

(from C32 Suite)
pic32-libs/include/cp0defs.h -> /home/pic32/pic32mx/include/cp0defs.h
pic32-libs/include/peripheral/* -> /home/pic32/pic32mx/include/peripheral/*
pic32-libs/include/p32xxxx.h -> /home/pic32/pic32mx/include/p32xxxx.h
pic32-libs/include/plib.h -> /home/pic32/pic32mx/include/plib.h
pic32-libs/include/proc/* -> /home/pic32/pic32mx/include/proc/*
pic32-libs/include/sys/attribs.h -> /home/pic32/pic32mx/include/sys/attribs.h

pic32-libs/c/startup/crt0.S -> (the directory where you are reading this
file)/newlib/libgloss/pic32mx/crt0.S

(you may need one or two other files, please let me know if thats the case)

5) Now, you can build newlib ->
cd into the newlib directory and type:
"./configure  --prefix=/home/pic32/ --target=pic32mx --enable-target-optspace --disable-newlib-atexit-alloc"
(you can read about the options i used in the newlib documentation)

6) Now type "make" and go have a cup of coffee, or a beer :)

7) When finished, type "make install"

8) optional, edit the GCC Spec file to specify what default libs to include:
/home/pic32/lib/gcc/pic32mx/3.4.4/specs
Go to Line 51 and Change it so it looks like this:
--start-group -lc -lm -le -lpic32 %{!mno-peripheral-libs:-lmchp_peripheral %{mprocessor=*:-lmchp_peripheral_%*}} --end-group
(basically, remove -ldsp and replace with -lpic32)

Now, you are ready to go!

(for a Example Makefile, look in the example directory)
